## Gate 1: the ESI per-file estimate was wrong by 4.2x

**Decision.** Correct `BYTES_PER_FILE_ESTIMATE` from 1_930_000 to 460_800 for
all *future* ESI fetches. Leave every historical ledger entry exactly as
written.

**Why.** The ESI GeoTIFFs are uncompressed float32 stored in single-row strips
(7200 x 1 x 4 bytes = 28.8 KB per strip). A county-scale window spans ~15 rows,
so a windowed read pulls ~16 strips = 460,800 bytes. The original 1.93 MB was a
guess. Measured from the file's own profile:

    blockxsize=7200 blockysize=1 tiled=False compress=None dtype=float32
    larimer window=25x15 -> 16 strips -> 0.46 MB
    pueblo  window=19x15 -> 17 strips -> 0.49 MB

**Consequence.** The ledger's 2124.7 MB is roughly 4.2x the true spend of about
507 MB. That overcharge is what raised `BudgetExceeded` on the Larimer ESI 12WK
series (207 files, projected 399.5 MB against 375.3 MB remaining). The budget
was never actually exhausted; the bookkeeping said it was.

**On not rewriting the ledger.** Retro-correcting the 1089 historical entries
was attempted and refused as audit tampering, which is correct. A download
ledger is an audit record: its value comes from being what was recorded at the
time. The corrected constant applies going forward, and this entry is the
reconciliation. Anyone reading `data/ledger.json` should treat its total as an
upper bound carrying a known 4.2x overcharge on the 1089 ESI entries.

**Honesty caveat.** 460_800 is still derived from the file layout, not observed
on the wire. True byte measurement was not possible in this environment: the
build has no `osgeo`, so GDAL's network counter is unavailable; `netstat -ib`
exposes only `lo0`; and GDAL's CPL_DEBUG stream could not be captured at either
the Python or the file-descriptor level. `_transferred_bytes()` in `esi.py` now
uses the GDAL counter where a build provides it, and records the estimate with
an "(estimated)" note otherwise, so the two are never confused again.

## Gate 1: ESI 12WK sampling holds only at stride 2

**Decision.** Keep biweekly (stride 2) sampling with linear interpolation. Do
not go coarser to save budget.

**Why.** Tested against the only true weekly 12WK series we hold (Pueblo 2021),
stride 2 gives mae/sd = 0.166 and stride 3 gives 0.195, both inside the 0.20
tolerance. But sub-sampling the biweekly series across all eight years, which
emulates stride 4, fails in 6 of 8 years:

    2018 0.177 PASS   2022 0.211 FAIL
    2019 0.241 FAIL   2023 0.230 FAIL
    2020 0.265 FAIL   2024 0.330 FAIL
    2021 0.206 FAIL   2025 0.163 PASS
    median 0.221, worst 0.330

The stride-3 pass rests on 2021 alone, and 2024 shows the assumption degrades
worst in volatile years, which are exactly the years the model must get right.
One favorable year is not evidence of generalisation.

**Caveat carried into Phase 3.** Stride 2 itself is validated on a single year,
because 2021 is the only year for which weekly 12WK was fetched. The ablation
must therefore report the interpolated-12WK arm as resting on a one-year
tolerance check, not a multi-year one.

## Gate 1: Larimer ESI coverage is elevation-limited, and that is confounded

**Observation.** After the v1 join, ESI 4WK is present on 84.6% of Larimer
cell-weeks but 99.2% of Pueblo's. The gap is spatial, not temporal: no cell is
entirely empty, but per-cell coverage ranges 0.592 to 0.993 in Larimer, and
correlates -0.828 with mean elevation. The worst cells sit at 3100-3400 m in
the Front Range; the best at 1900-2200 m on the plains.

**Why.** ESI derives from ALEXI thermal infrared, which requires clear-sky land
surface temperature retrievals. Persistent snow and cloud over high alpine
terrain leave those pixels legitimately missing. This is a property of the
instrument, not a fetch failure: 0 of 207 requests failed.

**Consequence for the ablation.** ESI availability in Larimer is a proxy for
low elevation. A tree can therefore gain apparent skill from the *missingness
pattern* rather than from the ESI values, because "ESI is present" partly
encodes "this is a plains cell", and plains and montane cells have different
drought and fire climatology. Any Larimer ESI lift must be read with this
confound in mind.

**Guard.** The ablation reports Larimer and Pueblo separately and never pools
them. Pueblo, at 99.2% coverage, is close to a clean test of the ESI signal;
Larimer is not. Agreement across the two domains is the evidence that a lift is
real, which is why the brief requires both. Where Larimer shows lift and Pueblo
does not, the finding is reported as confounded rather than as skill.
